## About Me

I am a M.S. student in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Yonsei University, advised by Prof. Joon Heo.  
I am conducting research at the [Spatial Computing for Sustainable Infrastructure Laboratory (SCSI Lab)](https://scsi.yonsei.ac.kr/).  
My research focuses on Spatial Data Science, Geospatial AI, Remote Sensing, and 3D Point Cloud.  
I expect to complete my M.S. degree in the first semester of 2026.


## Research Interests

- **Spatial Data Science:** Spatiotemporal modeling and large-scale geospatial analysis for understanding complex spatial patterns.  
- **Geospatial AI:** Deep learning-based analysis of satellite imagery, mobility data, and urban systems.  
- **Remote Sensing:** Multi-sensor data fusion (Landsat, MODIS, radar, LiDAR) for earth observation and environmental applications.  
- **3D Point Cloud:** 3D sensing and modeling for terrain analysis, infrastructure monitoring, and safety assessment.
