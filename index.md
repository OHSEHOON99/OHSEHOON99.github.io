## About Me

I am a M.S. student in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Yonsei University, advised by Prof. Joon Heo.  
I conduct research at the [Spatial Computing for Sustainable Infrastructure Laboratory (SCSI Lab)](https://scsi.yonsei.ac.kr/).  
My research focuses on Spatial Data Science, Remote Sensing, and 3D Point Cloud.  
I expect to complete my M.S. degree in the first semester of 2026.
